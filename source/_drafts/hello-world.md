Should my first post title be something different to "Hello World"? Obviously, not.
If you don't, let's know [who I am](/about) and here you can read what is this blog.

### The idea
The main reason which guided me to squander bunch of bits writing this things is that my memory is very unreliable. I'm goingo to write here stuff that could be usefull in the future, because is a very practical thing or because is an ispiration idea. Many profitable thoughts were made every single day in mind of everyone, thoutghs which will probably lost or remembered with a lot of effort: one of the oldest things on Earth is writing and it also is one of the oldest need of the humanity, so WRITE.

### How the idea becomes real
It is made through [Hexo](https://hexo.io), a powerful static-site generator written in NodeJS. Obviously, the choice was difficult: I was uncertain among it and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), written in Go with a increasing trend and a large community support; I also found other two valid frameworks - both two are sexy - doing the same (almost) thing: [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/) - whom father is VueJS - and [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) - whome father is ReactJS.

So the question is: Why Hexo?
- Is not coupled with an existing standalone framework.
- Has a great integration with GitHub Pages.
- Has the markdown support for post creation.
- Is fast.
